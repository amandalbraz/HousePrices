# HousePrices
## Python Advanced Regression - Kaggle Competition<br>
Predict sales prices and practice feature engineering, RFs and gradient boosting.<br>

### Competition Description<br>
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.<br>

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.<br>

### Practice Skills<br>
Creative feature engineering 
Advanced regression techniques like random forest and gradient boosting<br>

### Acknowledgments<br>
The Ames Housing dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education. It's an incredible alternative for data scientists looking for a modernized and expanded version of the often cited Boston Housing dataset. <br>

### Goal<br>
It is your job to predict the sales price for each house. For each Id in the test set, you must predict the value of the SalePrice variable. <br>
